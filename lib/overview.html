Welcome to the documentation for the Sheep framework!

<h1>Installing Android</h1>
<p>
	To install, follow the instructions found in the document 
	<a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.5_r1/installing.html">Installing the Android SDK</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	Note that when you have installed Eclipse, Android SDK and the Android Eclipse plug-in, you must create
	an <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/avd.html">Android Virtual Device</a>
	before you can debug or run your application. The easier way to do this is to start a command prompt, 
	browser to <android-sdk>/tools directory, and run: <code>android create avd -n Default -t 2</code>.
</p>


<h1>Using Sheep</h1>
<p>
Using Sheep is just like <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html">creating a normal Android application</a>, but adding a reference 
to the sheep library (the sheep.jar file). 

This is done by right clicking on your project, select <strong>Properties &gt; Java Build path 
&gt; Libraries &gt; Add Extern JARs</strong>. Locate sheep.jar, and add it to enable Sheep.
</p>

<p>
When creating a new project, the Android plugin will generate some files. If your project name
is MyGame, then it will generate MyGame.java. You should do three things:

<ol>
<li>Create an instance of sheep.game.Game. </li>
<li>Create a new subclass of sheep.game.State, let's call it TitleScreen. This will be the state 
the user initially sees when the application is started. Add an instance of the class to the newly created
game</li>
<li>Set the current view to the Game.</li>
</ol>

This is how your MyGame class should look:
<pre>

// Don't forget this!
import sheep.game.Game;

public class MyGame extends Activity {
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        
        // Create the game.
        Game game = new Game(this, null);
        
        // Push the main state.
        game.pushState(new TitleScreen());
        
        // View the game.
        setContentView(game);
    }
}
</pre>

That's it! Use the TitleScreen class to interface with the Sheep API. You can push other
game states from within a state, just use the getGame method. :)
